PanDA WMS
=========

This is the open source repository for the PanDA Workload Management System.

The PanDA (Production and Distributed Analysis) system was originally developed for the ATLAS experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by teams at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the University of Texas at Arlington. 

While it continues to be developed for the ATLAS experiment, where it is used for the globally distributed production and analysis processing of the experiment (150k concurrent jobs around the clock, a million jobs a day), it is also being generalized, extended and packaged for use by other scientific communities through the BigPanDA project supported by the US Department of Energy.
